Not meant to be used by anyone but myself, I don't read commits

I will try to make my code more readable for human beings

System used for making this terrible Quickshell config:

Distro: Arch Linux

Wayland compositor: Wayfire

You need these dependencies in order to work:

Cava

NetworkManager

Playerctl

DDCUtil (Setting screen brightness)

Python

Wayfire (Of course)

PyWayfire (Wayfire's IPC)
