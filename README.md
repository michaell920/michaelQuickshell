Not meant to be used by anyone but myself, I don't read commits  
I will try to make my code more readable for human beings, feel free to take my stuffs for your configuration  
I barely commented the codes so sorry for people who went through the pain to comprehend  

## Design philosophy
Waybar on steroids, theme agnostic  

## System used for making this terrible Quickshell config:
Distro: Arch Linux  
Wayland compositor: Wayfire  
Quickshell version: I don't know I got the master branch one  

## You need these dependencies in order to work property:
- Cava  
- NetworkManager  
- Playerctl  
- Qt6-5Compat (For graphical effects)  
- DDCUtil (Setting screen brightness)  
- Python  
- Wayfire (Of course)  
- PyWayfire (Wayfire's IPC)
- gtk-launch (Opening desktop entries)
- lm-sensors (Getting CPU temperature)
- UPower (setting power modes)  

## Features
- MPRIS bar with progress and Cava window showing up when the bar is clicked on  
- Window title bar for Wayfire  
- Clock (of course)  
- Wifi Indicator (not finished yet)  
- CPU Temperature  
- Power mode indicator (click to change modes)  
- External desktop monitor bar (scroll to control brightness)
